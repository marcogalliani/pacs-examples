# An example of a simple full matrix #

It allows both row-major and column-major ordering. The product with a standard vector has been implemented as well methods/functions to read/write from/to a file and to create a random matrix.

## Note ##

 *The tool may be used also by other examples*: do
 
 ```
 make install
```

to install `Matrix.hpp` in the right place!


# What do I learn here? #
The different ordering techniques and the different way to compute matrix times vector, according to the storage ordering, to reduce cache misses.
