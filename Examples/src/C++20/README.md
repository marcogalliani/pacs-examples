# SOME C++20 GOODIES #

Here you find examples that introduce some of the major additions of C++20:

- *Concepts* Provide semantic contraints to template parameter: more efficient and safe generic programming;
- *Ranges* A different way of handling containers and algorithm. Cleaner and more effective. It will probably rapidly become the normal way of programming with the containers of the standard library in modern C++;
- *Spaceship operator* and ordering categories. A new way of specifying relational operators.
