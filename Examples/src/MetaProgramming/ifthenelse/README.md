# My poor man version of std::conditional #

Just an example of template metaprogamming. Use `std::conditional` in your code.

# What do I learn here? #
- Two different technique to create an equivalent of `std::conditional`. The first is a classic one that uses class template specialization. The second uses also template specialization but with the help of another, apparently useless, template class.
