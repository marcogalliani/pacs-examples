/*! A general piecewise-linear interpolator
 *
 * This function is the building block for rather general
 * piecewise-liner interpolation It requires to have a range defined
 * by two bidirectional iterators in input. The iterators iterates
 * over a container of a generic type from which we can extract a
 * Key and a Value. The range must be strictly ordered with respect
 * to the key (i.e. without repetition of elements with equivalent
 * keys). The ordering relation must be specified as argument,
 * together as the functors that extract the key and the value from
 * the container, respectively. It is also assumed that usual
 * arithmetic operations may be performed on keys and values.
 *
 * If the value of the key where to interpolate falls between the
 * interval defined by the keys in the range, piecewise-linear
 * interpolation is performed. Otherwise, extrapolation is performed
 * using the last or first two elements of the container, depending
 * on the case.
 *
 * The procedure followed is a binary search (bisection) on the
 * keys.
 *
 * Complexity: if the iterator is a forward iterator the complexity
 * is log2 N, N being  the size of the range. otherwise complexity
 * is basically linear, because we need to advance iterators and
 * this is linear on non forward iterators
 *
 * @note We recall that the range is defined by [begin, end[
 *
 * @tparam RAIterator A bi-directional random-access iterator
 * @tparam Key The type of the Key
 * @tparam ExtractKey The type of the functor that extracts the key form a
 * dereferenced iterator
 * @tparam ExtractValue The type of functor that extracts the value form a
 * dereferenced iterator
 * @tparam CompareKey Type of comparison operator between keys
 * @param begin Start of the range
 * @param end   End of the range
 * @param keyVal The value of the key to interpolate
 * @param extractKey The actual functor for extraction of key
 * @param extractValue The actual functor for extraction of values
 * @param comp The comparison operator for keys (defaulted to std::less<Key>()
 * @return the value found in correspondence of keyVal. Type is automatically deduced.
 * @pre I need to have at least two interpolation nodes.
 * @pre Interpolation nodes must be distinct and sorted.
 * @pre Iterators must be (at least) bidirectional.
 * @throw a runtime standard exception if I do not have at least 2
