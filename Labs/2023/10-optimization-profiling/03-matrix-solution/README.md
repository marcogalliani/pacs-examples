# Instructions

`Makefile` contains the following targets.

> `make coverage`

generates a code coverage report.

> `make memcheck`

runs the memory check tool of `valgrind`.

> `make profile`

runs the `callgrind` tool of `valgrind` (profiler).
Results generated by `callgrind` can be inspected, *e.g.* with `KCacheGrind`(you can install it with `sudo apt-get install kcachegrind`).

**Note**: running with `valgrind` takes a lot more than a regular run!
Consider setting the matrix size equal to `100` (instead of `1000`) to get results in a reasonable time.

**Note**: `Makefile` provides *Debug* and *Release* targets that can be specified in the `BUILD` variable, e.g.: 

> `make BUILD=release`

that define different compilation flags (in particular the former enables debug and coverage generation mode).
Please do a `make distclean` when switching from one type of run to the other, otherwise your build may become **Corrupt**.
