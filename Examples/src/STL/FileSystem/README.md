# Interacting with the filesystem #

C++, since c++17, provides utilities that enable to analyse and traverse filesystems. In this directory we show an examples
of the filesystem utilities.

To use them you have to include `<filesystem>`. All utilities are in the namespace `std::filesystem`.

** Note ** This example shows only a small subset of the facilities available. Look at a good reference, like 
[here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem), to have more details on what you can do.
