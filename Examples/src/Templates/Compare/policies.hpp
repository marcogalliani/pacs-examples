  Note, Here am using the "vintage" form of std::toupper
  that works only with C-locale characters (i.e. ascii characters)
  If you want something able to operate on different character sets
  you have to use the version of toupper in <locale>, which is slightly
  more complex but can handle any locale character set.
  To do it, include <locale> and theplace the line with

  \code
  return std::toupper(a,std::locale())==std::toupper(b,std::locale());
  \endcode

However, in that case maybe you need to operate correctly with the character
type of your character encoding locale. I leave this to the interested readers,
here I am assuming that we are using the usual C-locale (the characters of the
US keyboard)
