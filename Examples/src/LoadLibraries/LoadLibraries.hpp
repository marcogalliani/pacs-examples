 * @brief An utility to load dynamic libraries by name and keep them in a common
 * repository
 *
 * The object of this class must be in the accessible for all the time the libraries
 * are used. Indeed it applies the RAII principle, and the descructor closes the
 * libraries. When a dynamic library is closed the symbols it provides are not
 * accessible anymore.
