/*! Memory leak.

An example which shows how it is dangerous to have functions which
returns pointers (or references) to an object created in the function.
This example wants to point a common error. Look at the comments
in the code!

A GENERAL RULE: Functions should always return objects. You can then
eventually use move semantic to optimize assigment of the return
object. At most you may return references/pointers to object passed as
arguments to the function (but always ask yoursef: is it necessary? A
part when defining operators normally the answer to this question is
NO).

Remember that "Resource acquisition is initialization!": what creates
a resource should also be responsible of its destruction.  If you need
to return a pointer (factories) return a "smart pointer" (which is in
fact an object that takes responsability of the owned resource).
