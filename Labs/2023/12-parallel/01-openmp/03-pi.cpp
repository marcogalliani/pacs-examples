 *
 * We declare sum as firstprivate, i.e. it's private but initialized
 * with the value defined in the master thread (0.0 in this case).
 *
 * We declare pi as shared, any thread can access it. Shared is the
 * default, however being explicit is not a bad thing. You should be
 * careful that multiple threads are not writing to shared variables
 * at the same time (race conditions, as in exercise 02).
 *
 * Specifying default(none) is also a good practice, so the compiler
 * forces us to specify whether each of the variables used herein
